# Embedded-Systems-Courses
Projects of embedded systems in STM32 boards.

Bare metal programming projects involving:
- Master-slave communication using SPI, UART and I2C.
- GPIO config. + breadboard to blink internal and external LED.
- Interrupts...

It's based on courses:
- Master microcontroller with embedded drivers.
- Master microcontroller: TIMERS, PMW, CAN, RTC, LOW POWER.
- Embedded system programming on ARM Cortex M3/M4 processor.
