# Embedded-Systems-Courses
Projects of embedded systems in STM32 boards.

Bare metal programming projects (mostly in stm32f4xx_drivers archive) involving:
- Master-slave communication using SPI, UART and I2C.
- GPIO config. + breadboard to blink internal and external LED.
- Interrupts...
- Traffic light control and other minors projects.
- Bootloader

FreeRTOS projects:
- Multitasking projects that use FreeRTOS API, CMSIS and peripheral of STM32F407xx boards.

It's based on courses:
- Master microcontroller with embedded drivers.
- Master microcontroller: TIMERS, PMW, CAN, RTC, LOW POWER.
- Embedded system programming on ARM Cortex M3/M4 processor.
- Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output
- Mastering RTOS: Hands on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging
