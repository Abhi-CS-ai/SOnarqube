# Embedded-Systems-Projects
Projects and small projects of embedded systems using STM32F407xx or TM4C123.

Bare metal programming projects involving:
- Master-slave communication using SPI, UART and I2C between STM32F407 / TM4C123xx and Arduino.
- Development of drivers of SPI, UART, I2C, ADC e etc.
- Traffic light control.
- Bootloader
- Measurement of distance using ultrasonic sensor
- Servo-motors and PWM.
- Development of drivers of STM32F407xx to communicate with LCD (HD44780)
- Measurement of the frequency and period of signal coming from Arduino to TM4C123.

FreeRTOS projects:
- Multitasking projects that use FreeRTOS, CMSIS and peripheral of STM32F407xx boards.

It's based on the book:
- ARM-Based Microcontroller Multitasking Projects Using the FreeRTOS

It's based on courses:
- Master microcontroller with embedded drivers.
- Master microcontroller: TIMERS, PMW, CAN, RTC, LOW POWER.
- Embedded system programming on ARM Cortex M3/M4 processor.
- Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Microcontroller Input/Output
- Mastering RTOS: Hands on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging
- Complete ARM Cortex-M Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up
